## Usage


## Roadmap

- Get the example JS demo widget/bokeh model to work - whatever that widget is. - done
- Figure out how to get values back to the python end with it.
- Figure out how to swap their control for the joystick (however hacky)
- Figure out how to make that tidier.
- Figure out how to publish to PyPi (alpha) and test in a pip installed test.
